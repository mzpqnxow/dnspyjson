# pyboot3 venv/.gitignore

# This requires a special .gitignore file because it is a prepackages
# set of files. It won't ever be changed by the user/developer when
# deploying a virtualenv or publishing, however it will be used by
# me when upgrading packages while performing maintenance on pyboot3
